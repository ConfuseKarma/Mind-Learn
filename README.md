# 📚 Mind&Learn — Reducing Functional Illiteracy through Gamified Learning

## Overview
Mind&Learn is an academic prototype developed by 4 Computer Engineering students as part of an interdisciplinary project (Project Management, Software Engineering, and Computer Networks).  
The main goal is to design and implement a **gamified mobile/web application** to help reduce **functional illiteracy in Brazil**.  

The prototype focuses on **reading comprehension, critical thinking, and interpretation skills**, using **quizzes, points, badges, and progress tracking** to engage learners.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a **prototype (MVP)** in 3 months (Aug–Nov/2025).  
- Apply **gamification and microlearning** to improve reading comprehension.  
- Validate the design with **pedagogical research (interviews with teachers)**.  
- Deliver a functional version for academic evaluation.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter or React Native (cross-platform mobile development)  
- **Backend/Database:** Firebase (free tier) or SQLite for local prototype  
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting / Localhost (for tests)  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub  
- **Design/Prototyping:** Figma  

---

## 🚀 Features (MVP Scope)
- User login (basic authentication)  
- Multiple-choice **quizzes** with increasing difficulty  
- **Points and badges** to reward progress  
- **Progress dashboard** (track completed activities)  
- Simple content updates (via Firebase or local DB)  

> ⚠️ Note: This is a **prototype**, not a production-ready system. Some advanced features (adaptive learning, large-scale deployment, advanced analytics) are out of scope.

---

## 📅 Project Timeline (Academic — 3 months)
- **Aug–Sep 2025:** Requirements gathering, pedagogical interviews, Figma prototype  
- **Sep–Oct 2025:** Development of core features (login, quiz system, database integration)  
- **Oct 2025:** Gamification features (points, badges, progress tracking)  
- **Nov 2025:** Testing, bug fixing, documentation, and final delivery  

---

## 👥 Team & Roles
- **Team Size:** 4 Computer Engineering students  
- **Roles:**  
  - Product Owner (rotating)  
  - Scrum Master (rotating)  
  - Developers (shared responsibilities)  

---

## 📊 Project Management
- **Methodology:** Agile (Scrum with 2–3 week sprints)  
- **Tools:**  
  - Trello (Kanban board for task tracking)  
  - GitHub (code repository + issues + wiki)  
  - Google Meet / Discord (weekly team meetings)  

---

## 🧪 Pedagogical Validation
We conducted **two interviews with pedagogy professionals** to validate the educational approach.  
Key insights:  
- Short, contextualized quizzes are effective.  
- Feedback should be **instructive, not only competitive**.  
- Daily micro-sessions (5–10 min) can improve engagement.  
- Pre/post-tests are recommended to measure learning progress.  

---

## 💰 Budget (Simulated Academic Context)
- **Operational costs:** ~R$ 1,880 (cloud, domain, interviews, testing device, materials)  
- **Personnel (simulation):** ~R$ 3,840 (384h × R$10/h for 4 students)  
- **Total:** ~R$ 5,720 (≈ USD 1,100)  

---

## 📈 Future Work
If expanded beyond the academic scope, the project could evolve into:  
- Adaptive learning algorithms (personalized quizzes).  
- Integration with schools and government educational programs.  
- Dashboards for teachers and administrators.  
- Wider device support and accessibility features.
